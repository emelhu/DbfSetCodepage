#DbfSetCodepage

Set codepage code byte in dbf file.


The header block of DBF datafile at position 29 ("Code page mark") stores one byte information of codepage of content.
If you have any problem of character set of dbf's viewed text maybe it's the root of problem.

This utility can set this information to expected value.
